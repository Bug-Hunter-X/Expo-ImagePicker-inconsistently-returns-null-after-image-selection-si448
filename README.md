# Expo ImagePicker Null Return Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo ImagePicker library.  The picker inconsistently returns `null` after a user successfully selects an image from their device's gallery.  This can cause unexpected errors and crashes in your application.

## Bug Description
The primary issue is the unpredictable nature of the `ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync()` function.  While often functioning correctly, it sometimes returns a `null` value even when an image has been chosen by the user.  This inconsistency is difficult to debug and can lead to errors when attempting to use the selected image.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the application using `expo start`.
4. Select an image from your device's image library.
5. Observe that the image may sometimes be correctly processed, while other times the application will fail due to a `null` value being returned from `ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync()`.

## Solution
The solution involves adding error handling and retries to gracefully manage the `null` return. This ensures that the application continues to function even if the initial picker result is unexpectedly `null`.
